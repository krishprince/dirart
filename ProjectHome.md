DIRART is a MATLAB toolbox, as well as a stand-alone MATLAB application, for deformable image registration (DIR) and adaptive radiotherapy (ART) research. It contains well implemented DIR algorithms and the essential functions for ART applications. Please see my Medical Physics paper "Technical Note: DIRART – A software suite for deformable image registration and adaptive radiotherapy research" for short instruction and see the user instruction manual in the document section below.

The name DIRART stands for DIR+ART.

You need MATLAB to run DIRART.
You need CERR (http://code.google.com/p/cerr/) as well.

# Source code #
> [Get source code using subversion clients](http://code.google.com/p/dirart/source/checkout)

  * To download the source code, you need a subversion software tool and a googlecode account. (I use TortoiseSVN, which is very good and free). Using subversion allows you to get update easily and to commit your changes back to googlecode easily.
  * Please contact project owner(s) if you want to commit. Your google account needs to be added to the committer list before you can do so.
  * Download is also available as zipped files.

To do so:
  1. Download and install TortoiseSVN (from http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/). It will be integrated into your Windows explorer.
  1. On your PC, create a folder in which you are going to store the source code.
  1. Into the folder in your Windows explorer, right click your mouse, use "SVN Checkout..." from the popup menu
  1. Enter the URL: "https://dirart.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ dirart-read-only", or just "https://dirart.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/"
  1. Answer your googlecode password when asked.
  1. TortoiseSVN should download the whole project into the folder.
  1. Don't delete the "svn" subfolder which should be hidden anyway.
  1. Yes you can rename your folder name. As far as the "svn" subfolder is in there, TortoiseSVN will know where the files were originally from.

How to get the googlecode password:
  1. Login to your google account
  1. Get your password at "http://code.google.com/hosting/settings"
